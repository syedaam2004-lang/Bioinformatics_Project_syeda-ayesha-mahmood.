ORF1 was selected as the most likely coding region for the following reasons:


Length: ORF1 is the longest open reading frame identified, spanning 471 nucleotides and encoding a protein of 156 amino acids.
+1


Biological Significance: It matches the known protein length for the Homo sapiens CDKN2A gene (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A), which was confirmed in your BLAST results.
+1


Frame and Strand: It is located on the positive (+) strand in Frame 1, beginning at nucleotide 31 and ending at 501.
+1


Start Codon: It utilizes a standard 'ATG' start codon, which is the most common initiation site for eukaryotic translation
